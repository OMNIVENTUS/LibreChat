# Git Conventions
We utilize a GitFlow workflow to manage changes to this project's codebase. Follow these general steps when contributing code:

Fork the repository and create a new branch with a descriptive slash-based name (e.g., new/feature/x).
Implement your changes and ensure that all tests pass.
Commit your changes using conventional commit messages with GitFlow flags. Begin the commit message with a tag indicating the change type, such as "feat" (new feature), "fix" (bug fix), "docs" (documentation), or "refactor" (code refactoring), followed by a brief summary of the changes (e.g., feat: Add new feature X to the project).
Submit a pull request with a clear and concise description of your changes and the reasons behind them.
We will review your pull request, provide feedback as needed, and eventually merge the approved changes into the main branch.

Commit Message Format
We follow the semantic format for commit messages.

Example
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
Commit Guidelines
Do your best to reduce the number of commits, organizing them as much possible. Look into squashing commits in order to keep a neat history.
For those that care about maximizing commits for stats, adhere to the above as I 'squash and merge' an unorganized and/or unformatted commit history, which reduces the number of your commits to 1,:
* Update Br.tsx

* Update Es.tsx

* Update Br.tsx

Naming Conventions
Apply the following naming conventions to branches, labels, and other Git-related entities:

Branch names: Descriptive and slash-based (e.g., new/feature/x).
Labels: Descriptive and kebab case (e.g., bug-fix).
JS/TS: Directories and file names: Descriptive and camelCase. First letter uppercased for React files (e.g., helperFunction.ts, ReactComponent.tsx).
Docs: Directories and file names: Descriptive and snake_case (e.g., config_files.md).
